# Deployment

Velocity Pro generates a fully static site that can be deployed anywhere. Here's how to deploy to the most popular platforms.

## GitHub Pages

1. Update `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://username.github.io',
  base: '/repo-name',
});
```

2. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist/
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

3. Push to `main` — your site deploys automatically.

## Vercel

The easiest option. Just connect your repo:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import your repository
4. Vercel auto-detects Astro — click **Deploy**

No configuration needed. Vercel handles everything.

## Netlify

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
3. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
4. Select your repository
5. Build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`

## Cloudflare Pages

```bash
# Install Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# Build and deploy
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist/
```

## Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

## Environment Variables

For builds that need environment variables:

```bash
# .env (local development)
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

> **Note:** Only variables prefixed with `PUBLIC_` are available in the client bundle.

## Build Output

After `npm run build`, your static files are in the `dist/` directory. You can serve these with any static file server:

```bash
npx serve dist/
```
