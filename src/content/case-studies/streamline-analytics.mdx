## The Challenge

Streamline Analytics is a business intelligence platform serving mid-market companies. With 2,300 customers and growing 40% year-over-year, their biggest bottleneck wasn't acquiring customers — it was onboarding them.

Their onboarding process required an average of **14 days** from signup to first value. During that time, a Customer Success Manager would manually:

- Configure data connectors for each customer's tech stack
- Build initial dashboard templates based on the customer's industry
- Schedule and conduct three training calls
- Follow up on outstanding setup tasks via email
- Verify data accuracy and dashboard completeness

Each CSM could handle only 8-10 new customer onboardings per month. With 80+ new customers signing up monthly, the team was underwater.

**The cost was staggering:**
- 12% of new customers churned during onboarding (before seeing any value)
- CSM team burned out, with 35% annual turnover
- Average time-to-first-value was 14 days (industry best practice: 3-5 days)

## The Solution

Streamline's CTO discovered Velocity while searching for workflow automation tools that could handle complex, multi-step processes with conditional logic.

### Phase 1: Automated Data Connection (Week 1-2)

The team built automated workflows that detected each customer's tech stack during signup and pre-configured the appropriate data connectors. Instead of a CSM manually setting up Salesforce, HubSpot, and Stripe integrations, Velocity handled the OAuth flows, data mapping, and initial sync automatically.

### Phase 2: Smart Template Generation (Week 3-4)

Using Velocity's templating engine, Streamline created industry-specific dashboard packages. When a new e-commerce customer signed up, they automatically received dashboards for revenue analytics, customer cohorts, and inventory forecasting — pre-populated with their actual data.

### Phase 3: Guided Onboarding Flow (Week 5-6)

The team replaced their three-call training program with an interactive, in-app onboarding flow powered by Velocity. The flow adapted based on the customer's actions — if they hadn't connected a data source after 24 hours, they received a targeted nudge. If they completed setup quickly, they were fast-tracked to advanced features.

## The Results

Six months after implementing Velocity:

### Onboarding Metrics
- **Time to first value:** 14 days → 4.5 days (68% reduction)
- **Onboarding completion rate:** 88% → 97%
- **Customer touches required:** 8-12 per customer → 2-3 per customer

### Business Impact
- **First-90-day churn:** 12% → 3.8%
- **CSM capacity:** 8-10 customers/month → 30+ customers/month
- **CSM team satisfaction:** NPS went from 22 to 71
- **Annual cost savings:** $340,000 in reduced CSM hiring needs

### Customer Feedback
Post-onboarding NPS scores improved from 34 to 72. Customers specifically praised the speed of setup and the quality of pre-built dashboards.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Automation doesn't mean impersonal.** Streamline's automated onboarding actually felt more personal because customers got relevant content immediately instead of waiting for a CSM to have availability.

2. **Start with the highest-volume, most-repetitive steps.** Data connector setup was the biggest time sink and the most automatable. Starting there gave the team quick wins and built confidence.

3. **Keep humans in the loop for edge cases.** The automated flow includes escalation triggers — if a customer's data sync fails twice, a CSM is automatically notified. This hybrid approach ensures no customer falls through the cracks.
