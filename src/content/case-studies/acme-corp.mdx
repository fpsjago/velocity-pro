## The Challenge

Acme Corp's marketing site hadn't been updated in three years. Built on a legacy WordPress installation, it was slow, unresponsive on mobile, and losing potential customers at every touchpoint.

## The Solution

Using Velocity Pro as a foundation, Acme's team rebuilt their entire marketing presence in under two weeks. The template's pre-built components meant they could focus on content and messaging rather than building UI from scratch.

## Key Changes

- **Performance overhaul** — Page load times dropped from 8.3s to 2.1s
- **Mobile-first redesign** — 68% of their traffic is mobile
- **Clear pricing page** — Interactive comparison reduced support questions by 45%
- **Blog integration** — Content marketing drove 3x organic traffic

## Results

Within 90 days of launching the new site, Acme saw dramatic improvements across every metric that matters.
