## The Challenge

Meridian Health operates 140 outpatient clinics across the southeastern United States, processing over 2 million patient encounters annually. Their core challenge: ensuring data accuracy across a fragmented technology landscape.

Each clinic used a combination of:
- Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems (3 different vendors)
- Practice management software
- Insurance verification tools
- Lab integration platforms
- Patient communication systems

Data flowed between these systems through a combination of manual entry, batch CSV imports, and fragile API integrations built by a rotating cast of contractors. The result: a **4.7% error rate** in patient records.

In healthcare, a 4.7% error rate is alarming. It meant incorrect insurance billing (leading to claim denials), mismatched lab results, and — in the worst cases — potential clinical safety issues.

## The Regulatory Pressure

HIPAA compliance added another layer of complexity. Every data flow needed audit trails, encryption in transit and at rest, and role-based access controls. The manual workarounds that clinic staff had developed to bridge system gaps were, in many cases, compliance violations waiting to be discovered.

When Meridian's compliance team conducted an audit in early 2025, they identified 23 data flows that didn't meet HIPAA requirements. The remediation timeline was aggressive: six months to achieve full compliance or face potential penalties.

## The Solution

Meridian's IT team evaluated five workflow automation platforms. Velocity won for three reasons:

1. **HIPAA-compliant infrastructure** with BAA (Business Associate Agreement) support
2. **Complex conditional logic** for handling the nuances of healthcare data
3. **Audit trail** built into every workflow execution

### Implementation

The implementation happened in three phases over four months:

**Phase 1: Insurance Verification (Month 1)**
Automated the insurance eligibility verification process that previously required staff to manually check each patient's coverage before appointments. Velocity workflows now verify eligibility in real-time, flag discrepancies, and update records across all connected systems simultaneously.

**Phase 2: Lab Result Integration (Month 2-3)**
Built workflows that automatically receive lab results, match them to the correct patient record (using a multi-factor matching algorithm), and route them to the ordering physician. Previously, this process involved manual data entry by clinic staff, introducing errors at every step.

**Phase 3: Cross-System Reconciliation (Month 4)**
Created nightly reconciliation workflows that compare patient records across all systems, identify discrepancies, and either auto-resolve them (for clear-cut cases) or flag them for human review (for ambiguous situations).

## The Results

After six months of operation:

- **Data error rate:** 4.7% → 0.1% (99.9% accuracy)
- **Insurance claim denial rate:** 8.3% → 2.1%
- **Staff hours on manual data entry:** 1,200 hrs/month → 310 hrs/month
- **HIPAA compliance findings:** 23 → 0
- **Revenue recovered from reduced claim denials:** $1.8M annually

## Looking Ahead

Meridian is now expanding their use of Velocity to automate patient communication workflows, appointment scheduling optimization, and predictive analytics for no-show rates. The platform has become central to their digital transformation strategy.
