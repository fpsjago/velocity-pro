## The Challenge

NovaCommerce is a direct-to-consumer brand selling premium home goods across North America and Europe. In 2024, they were processing 10,000 orders per month with a 6-person operations team.

Their growth trajectory was exciting — 15% month-over-month — but their operations couldn't keep up. The process for each order involved:

1. **Order validation** — Check inventory, verify shipping address, flag potential fraud
2. **Warehouse routing** — Determine optimal fulfillment center based on customer location and inventory
3. **Shipping label generation** — Select carrier, generate label, update tracking
4. **Customer communication** — Send confirmation, shipping updates, delivery notification
5. **Returns processing** — Handle return requests, generate return labels, process refunds
6. **Exception handling** — Address issues, out-of-stock items, failed deliveries

Each step involved manual intervention, switching between 4-5 different tools, and constant Slack communication between team members. Average order fulfillment time was 18 hours, and the error rate was 3.2% — resulting in costly re-ships and customer complaints.

## The Breaking Point

During Black Friday 2024, order volume spiked to 3x normal levels. The operations team worked 16-hour days for a week. Despite the heroic effort, order accuracy dropped to 91%, fulfillment times stretched to 48 hours, and customer satisfaction scores plummeted.

The post-mortem was clear: they needed to automate or they needed to triple their team size. Tripling the team would cost $480K annually and still wouldn't solve the quality problem.

## The Solution

NovaCommerce chose Velocity to build an end-to-end order automation pipeline.

### The Automated Pipeline

**Order Intake & Validation**
Every new order triggers a Velocity workflow that automatically validates the shipping address (via address verification API), checks real-time inventory across all warehouses, and runs fraud detection rules. Orders that pass all checks move to fulfillment automatically. Flagged orders are routed to a human review queue.

**Intelligent Warehouse Routing**
A routing algorithm considers three factors: proximity to the customer (for fastest delivery), current inventory levels (to balance stock across locations), and carrier rates (to minimize shipping cost). The algorithm improved routing efficiency by 34% compared to the team's manual decisions.

**Automated Fulfillment**
Once routed, the workflow generates pick lists, prints shipping labels, and sends warehouse notifications — all without human intervention. The warehouse team simply picks, packs, and ships.

**Proactive Customer Communication**
Customers receive real-time updates at every stage: order confirmed, picked, shipped, out for delivery, delivered. If there's a delay, they're notified proactively with a revised estimate. This reduced "where is my order?" support tickets by 73%.

**Returns Automation**
Return requests trigger a workflow that evaluates the reason, auto-approves eligible returns, generates a prepaid return label, and initiates the refund upon receipt confirmation. Return processing time dropped from 5 days to 8 hours.

## The Results

Over 12 months:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Monthly orders | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| Operations team size | 6 people | 6 people |
| Avg. fulfillment time | 18 hours | 4.8 hours |
| Order accuracy | 96.8% | 99.2% |
| WISMO tickets/month | 2,400 | 640 |
| Return processing time | 5 days | 8 hours |

The financial impact was significant:

- **Avoided hiring costs:** $640K (8 additional hires not needed)
- **Reduced re-ship costs:** $180K annually
- **Shipping optimization savings:** $340K annually
- **Net annual savings:** $1.2M

## Key Insights

**Automate the happy path first.** 85% of orders are straightforward. Automating those freed the team to focus on the 15% that genuinely needed human judgment.

**Measure everything.** Before Velocity, NovaCommerce couldn't tell you their average fulfillment time with confidence. Now they track 40+ operational metrics in real-time.

**Don't automate bad processes.** Before building workflows, NovaCommerce spent two weeks mapping and improving their processes. Automating a broken process just creates broken automation faster.
