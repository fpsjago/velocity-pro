## The Challenge

Nova Analytics had a powerful product but their website didn't reflect it. Their original site was a single-page React app that was slow to load and impossible to find on Google.

## The Solution

Velocity Pro's static-first approach gave Nova the SEO foundation they needed while the interactive React islands kept the site feeling modern and dynamic.

## Results

The new site launched in 12 days and immediately started driving qualified enterprise leads.
