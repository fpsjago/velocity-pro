## Real-Time Collaboration

Teams can now work on the same workflow simultaneously. You'll see live cursors for each team member, with real-time sync powered by our custom CRDT engine. No more "someone else is editing this" warnings.

## Team Analytics Dashboard

The new dashboard gives team leads visibility into how workflows are performing across the organization. Track execution counts, failure rates, and resource usage — all in one place.
