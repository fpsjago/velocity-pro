## Custom Functions

Power users can now write custom JavaScript or TypeScript functions directly in the workflow editor. Functions have access to a sandboxed runtime with built-in utilities for data transformation, HTTP requests, and date manipulation.

## Scheduled Triggers

Workflows can now be triggered on a schedule using standard cron syntax. Configure timezone-aware schedules with execution history and failure notifications.
