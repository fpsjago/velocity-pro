## The PLG Bet

In Q1 2024, we made a decision that terrified our board: we would not hire a sales team. Instead, we would invest everything in making our product so good that it sold itself.

This wasn't naive optimism. We'd studied the playbooks of Slack, Figma, Notion, and Datadog. We knew product-led growth could work — but we also knew that most companies that attempt it fail.

Here's what we learned along the way.

## Phase 1: The Free Tier (Months 1-3)

Our first critical decision was designing a free tier that was genuinely useful, not a glorified demo. We studied what made users successful in our product and made sure every one of those capabilities was available for free, with reasonable limits.

### The Magic Number

Through cohort analysis, we discovered our "magic number": users who created 3 or more workflows in their first week had a 67% chance of converting to paid within 60 days. Users who created fewer had only an 8% chance.

This insight shaped everything. Our onboarding flow was redesigned to get users to that third workflow as quickly as possible. We added templates, suggested next steps, and proactive emails — all focused on that single metric.

### What We Measured

We tracked five key metrics religiously:

1. **Time to first value** — How long until a user experiences the core benefit?
2. **Activation rate** — What percentage of signups reach our "magic number"?
3. **Natural virality coefficient** — How many new users does each user bring in?
4. **Free-to-paid conversion rate** — What percentage of free users convert?
5. **Expansion revenue** — How much do existing customers grow?

## Phase 2: The Growth Loops (Months 4-8)

Growth loops are the engine of PLG. Unlike funnels (which are linear), loops create compounding returns. We built three:

### Loop 1: Shared Outputs

When users create reports or dashboards in Velocity, they share them with colleagues and clients. Those recipients see a "Powered by Velocity" badge and a prompt to create their own account. This single loop drove 34% of our signups.

### Loop 2: Template Marketplace

We built a marketplace where users could publish workflow templates. Popular template creators got recognition and premium features. The marketplace attracted organic search traffic (templates ranked well for long-tail keywords) and gave new users a fast path to value.

### Loop 3: Integrations as Distribution

Every integration we built had a bidirectional component. When users connected Velocity to Slack, their Slack workspace got a Velocity bot that provided useful updates. Colleagues who saw these updates got curious. This loop was slower to build but had the highest conversion rate.

## Phase 3: Monetization (Months 9-14)

The hardest part of PLG isn't getting users — it's getting them to pay. We experimented with three monetization strategies:

**Usage-based pricing** worked for power users but created anxiety for others. People don't want to worry about their bill going up unpredictably.

**Feature gating** worked when the gated features were clearly "team" or "enterprise" features. But when we gated features that individual users wanted, it felt punitive and drove churn.

**The hybrid model** is what we landed on. A generous free tier, a predictable per-seat price for teams, and usage-based pricing only for clearly metered resources (API calls, storage, compute). This gave us the best of all worlds: low friction for adoption, predictable costs for budgeting, and upside capture for heavy usage.

## The Results

After 14 months of pure PLG:

- **10,247 paying customers** (up from 0)
- **$2.1M ARR** with 15% month-over-month growth
- **Net Revenue Retention:** 127% (existing customers expanding)
- **CAC Payback Period:** 4 months (industry average: 12-18)
- **Viral coefficient:** 1.4 (each user brings in 1.4 more over their lifetime)

We eventually did hire salespeople — but only for enterprise deals over $50K ARR. Everything under that is still purely self-serve.

## What Didn't Work

Not everything was a success. Here are our biggest misses:

**Gamification flopped.** We added points, badges, and leaderboards. Users found them patronizing. We removed them after two months.

**In-app upgrade prompts were too aggressive.** Our first iteration showed upgrade prompts every time a user hit a limit. This drove support tickets and negative reviews. We switched to showing the prompt once, then using email follow-ups instead.

**Community building was premature.** We launched a Discord community at 500 users. It was a ghost town. We relaunched at 5,000 users and it thrived. Timing matters.

## Advice for PLG Founders

If you're considering a PLG strategy, here's what I'd tell you:

1. **Your product has to be genuinely good.** PLG amplifies quality in both directions. A great product creates viral loops. A mediocre product creates viral complaints.

2. **Invest in instrumentation from day one.** You can't optimize what you can't measure. We track over 200 events per user session.

3. **Be patient.** PLG compounds over time. Our first three months were painful. Month 4 was the inflection point.

4. **Don't fight your pricing model.** If users resist your pricing, the problem is usually the pricing, not the users. Listen and adapt.

Product-led growth isn't a shortcut. It's a fundamentally different way of building a business — one where the product is the primary driver of acquisition, conversion, and expansion. When it works, it's magic.
