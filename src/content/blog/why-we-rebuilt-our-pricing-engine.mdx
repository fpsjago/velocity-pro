## The Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

Every SaaS company eventually faces the same reckoning: your billing system, the thing that literally keeps the lights on, becomes the biggest bottleneck to growth. Ours was no different.

When we launched Velocity in 2023, our pricing was simple. Three tiers, monthly billing, done. We used Stripe's basic subscription API and called it a day. It worked perfectly — for about six months.

## When Simple Breaks Down

The first cracks appeared when we introduced annual billing. Then came enterprise plans with custom pricing. Then usage-based add-ons. Then mid-cycle upgrades and downgrades. Then prorations. Then credits.

Each feature was a patch on top of the previous patch. Our billing code became a tangled web of edge cases.

## The Decision to Rebuild

After a particularly painful quarter where a billing bug cost us $47,000 in lost revenue, we made the call: rebuild from scratch.

Here's what we prioritized:

- **Event-sourced billing** — Every change is an immutable event
- **Idempotent operations** — Safe to retry any operation
- **Real-time metering** — Usage tracked to the second
- **Plan versioning** — Change pricing without affecting existing subscribers

## Results

After the migration:

- **99.99% billing accuracy** (up from 99.2%)
- **New pricing features ship in days**, not weeks
- **Zero billing-related support tickets** in the first month
