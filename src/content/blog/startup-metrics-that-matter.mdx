## The Dashboard Trap

I've seen founders with 47 metrics on their dashboard who can't answer the question: "Is your business healthy?" Having more data doesn't mean having more insight. In fact, it usually means the opposite.

After advising 30+ early-stage SaaS companies and building Velocity from zero to $2M ARR, I've narrowed it down to seven metrics. These are the numbers that actually predict outcomes.

## 1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

This is your pulse. Not revenue, not bookings — MRR. The predictable, recurring portion of your income.

Track three components separately:
- **New MRR** — Revenue from new customers
- **Expansion MRR** — Revenue growth from existing customers
- **Churned MRR** — Revenue lost from cancellations and downgrades

When Expansion MRR exceeds Churned MRR, you've hit **net negative churn** — the holy grail of SaaS. Your existing customer base grows even without new acquisitions.

## 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

How much does it cost to acquire a paying customer? Include everything: marketing spend, sales salaries, tooling, content creation.

The formula: `Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired`

**Benchmarks:**
- Self-serve SaaS: $100-500 CAC is healthy
- Sales-assisted: $1,000-5,000 is normal
- Enterprise: $10,000-50,000 is typical

The absolute number matters less than the ratio to your next metric.

## 3. Lifetime Value (LTV)

How much revenue does a customer generate over their entire relationship with you?

Simple formula: `Average MRR per Customer × Average Customer Lifetime (months)`

**The golden ratio:** LTV should be at least 3x your CAC. Below 3x, you're likely burning cash faster than you're creating value. Above 5x, you might be under-investing in growth.

At Velocity, our LTV:CAC ratio is currently 4.2x. We're comfortable with this — high enough to be profitable, low enough that we're still investing aggressively in growth.

## 4. Churn Rate

Monthly churn rate tells you what percentage of customers leave each month.

Formula: `Customers Lost This Month / Customers at Start of Month`

**Benchmarks:**
- less than 2% monthly churn: Excellent
- 2-5% monthly churn: Acceptable for SMB
- 5-7% monthly churn: Concerning
- >7% monthly churn: Fix this before anything else

A subtlety many founders miss: churn is not constant. It typically follows a bathtub curve — high in the first 30 days (users who never activated), low in the middle (happy users), and gradually increasing over time (feature fatigue).

Focus your retention efforts on the first 30 days. That's where you'll get the biggest ROI.

## 5. Activation Rate

What percentage of signups reach your "aha moment"? This is arguably the most important metric for PLG companies and the most commonly ignored.

Defining your activation event requires data analysis and user research. For us, it's "created 3 workflows in the first 7 days." For Slack, it was famously "2,000 messages sent by the team." For Dropbox, it was "1 file saved to Dropbox folder."

If your activation rate is below 25%, your onboarding is broken. Fix that before spending another dollar on acquisition.

## 6. Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

NRR measures how much revenue you retain and expand from existing customers over 12 months.

Formula: `(Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR × 100`

**Benchmarks:**
- >120%: World-class (Snowflake, Twilio territory)
- 100-120%: Strong
- 90-100%: Needs work
- less than 90%: Leaky bucket

NRR above 100% means your existing customers are growing. This is the most powerful growth lever in SaaS because it compounds without acquisition costs.

## 7. Burn Multiple

The burn multiple tells you how efficiently you're converting spend into growth.

Formula: `Net Burn / Net New ARR`

A burn multiple of 1x means you're spending $1 for every $1 of new ARR. That's efficient. A burn multiple of 3x means you're spending $3 for every $1 of new ARR. That's expensive.

**Benchmarks:**
- less than 1x: Amazing efficiency
- 1-1.5x: Good
- 1.5-2x: Acceptable
- >2x: Likely unsustainable

This metric is especially important in the current funding environment. Investors are looking for efficient growth, not growth at any cost.

## How We Use These at Velocity

Every Monday morning, our leadership team reviews these seven numbers. The meeting takes 15 minutes. We look at the trend (up, down, flat), identify anything that moved more than 10% week-over-week, and decide if action is needed.

That's it. No 47-metric dashboard. No hour-long analytics deep dives. Seven numbers, fifteen minutes, clear decisions.

The simplicity is the point. When you track fewer things, you can actually act on what you see.
