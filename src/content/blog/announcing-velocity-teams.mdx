Today marks the biggest product launch in Velocity's history. After eight months of development and a three-month beta with 200+ teams, we're thrilled to announce **Velocity Teams**.

## Why Teams?

When we launched Velocity, we built it for individual power users — founders, freelancers, and solo operators who needed to move fast. And that worked. But as our users grew, something interesting happened: they started inviting their colleagues.

At first, collaboration was... rough. Users shared credentials (please don't), exported data via CSV (painful), and coordinated via Slack messages (chaotic). Every week, we'd hear the same request: "We love Velocity. Can you make it work for our team?"

So we did.

## What's in Velocity Teams?

### Real-Time Collaboration

Multiple team members can work on the same workflow simultaneously. You'll see live cursors, real-time updates, and inline comments — similar to the experience you'd expect from Figma or Google Docs, but for workflow automation.

Under the hood, we built a custom CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) engine optimized for our data model. This means no conflicts, no data loss, and no "someone else is editing this" locks.

### Shared Workspaces

Teams get a shared workspace where workflows, templates, and data sources live together. No more duplicating configurations or manually syncing settings across accounts.

Each workspace has its own billing, its own integrations, and its own audit log. If you're in a regulated industry, the audit log alone might be worth the upgrade.

### Granular Permissions

Not everyone on a team needs the same access. Velocity Teams ships with four roles out of the box — Owner, Admin, Editor, and Viewer — plus the ability to create custom roles with fine-grained permissions down to the workflow level.

### Team Analytics

A dedicated analytics dashboard shows team activity, workflow performance, and resource usage. Managers can see which workflows are most used, which are failing, and where bottlenecks exist — without diving into individual workflows.

## Pricing

Velocity Teams starts at **$29/user/month** with a minimum of 3 seats. This includes everything in our Pro plan plus all team features.

For larger teams (50+ seats), we offer volume discounts and dedicated support. Contact our sales team for a custom quote.

Existing Pro customers can upgrade to Teams from their billing settings. Your existing workflows and data will be preserved — no migration needed.

## What's Next

Teams is just the beginning of our collaboration story. On the roadmap:

- **Guest access** — Invite external collaborators with limited permissions
- **Team templates** — Shared template libraries curated by your team
- **SSO & SCIM** — Enterprise identity management (coming Q1 2026)
- **Cross-workspace workflows** — Connect workflows across team boundaries

We're incredibly grateful to the beta testers who shaped this launch. Your feedback made Teams significantly better than what we originally envisioned.
