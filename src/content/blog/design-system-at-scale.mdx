## The Design System Graveyard

If you've worked in tech for more than a few years, you've probably seen it: a design system that launched with great fanfare, got adopted by two teams, then slowly withered as components fell out of sync and documentation went stale.

We've been there. Twice, actually. Our first design system in 2023 lasted about eight months before it became more of a suggestion than a standard. The second attempt made it to fourteen months before the same fate.

The third time, we decided to approach it differently. Not as a design project, but as a product.

## Treating the Design System as a Product

The shift in mindset was everything. Instead of a set of components maintained by the design team in their spare time, we created a dedicated design systems team with its own roadmap, its own sprint cycles, and its own success metrics.

Our team structure:

- **1 Design Systems Lead** (hybrid designer/engineer)
- **2 Design Engineers** (they build the components)
- **1 Technical Writer** (documentation is not optional)
- **0.5 Product Manager** (shared with platform team)

Yes, that's a significant investment. For a company our size (180 people, 12 product teams), it pays for itself many times over.

### The Adoption Problem

Here's the uncomfortable truth about design systems: **nobody is obligated to use yours.** Product teams have deadlines, and if your design system adds friction instead of removing it, they'll work around it.

We tracked adoption with a simple metric: what percentage of new UI code uses design system components versus custom implementations? When we started measuring, the number was 34%. Our goal was 85%.

To get there, we focused on three things:

**1. Make it easier than the alternative.** Every component ships with copy-paste examples, live previews, and Figma components that generate code. If it's faster to use our button than to write your own, people will use our button.

**2. Accept contributions gracefully.** When a product team needs a component we don't have, we don't say "add it to the backlog." We pair with them to build it, then generalize it for the system.

**3. Break nothing.** We follow strict semantic versioning. If a team is on v2 of our system, upgrading to v2.x will never break their code. Major versions get a 6-month migration window with automated codemods.

## Component Architecture

Our components are built in three layers:

### Primitives
Unstyled, accessible building blocks. A `Pressable` that handles keyboard and mouse interaction. A `Overlay` that manages focus trapping and portals. These never change once stable.

### Composites
Components that combine primitives with our design tokens. Buttons, inputs, cards, modals. These are what most teams interact with daily.

### Patterns
Pre-built layouts and page sections that combine composites. Onboarding flows, settings pages, data tables with filters. These are opinionated and save the most time.

## Measuring Success

After 18 months of running the design system as a product, here's where we stand:

- **Component adoption:** 34% → 89%
- **Design-to-dev handoff time:** Reduced by 60%
- **Visual inconsistencies in production:** Down 82%
- **New feature shipping time:** 23% faster on average
- **Designer satisfaction score:** 4.2/5 → 4.7/5

The numbers tell a clear story, but the qualitative feedback is even more telling. Engineers tell us they spend less time arguing about UI implementation details. Designers tell us they can focus on solving problems instead of recreating components. Product managers tell us they can ship faster without sacrificing quality.

## What's Next

We're now exploring AI-assisted component generation — using our design tokens and component API patterns to generate new components from natural language descriptions. Early experiments are promising, but we're being cautious about quality.

The design system is never "done." It's a living product that evolves with the needs of the teams it serves. And that's exactly how it should be.
